# Embedding Model with Instructions

This project demonstrates the usage of various text embedding models to encode sentences into dense vectors. The models used include BERT, Sentence Transformer, T5, and Instructor. The code provides a pipeline to extract features from these models. **TODO**

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZikunFu/Embedding-Model-with-Instructions.git
cd Embedding-Model-with-Instructions
```

### For Conda

```bash
conda create --name embed --file requirements.txt
conda activate embed
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate the environment.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook.
